\chapter{Literature Review}
Deepfakes, which involve sharing facial images without permission, are often carried out without the knowledge or consent of individuals such as celebrities or politicians. At first, swapping of face image was done in the photo of Abraham Lincoln(Badale et al., 2018)\cite{badale2018deep}. Yang, Li \& Lyu (2019)\cite{yang2019exposing} have proposed a model to detect deep fake using head poses inconsistency. Yadav \& Salmani (2019)\cite{yadav2019deepfake} have described the working principle of the deep fake techniques along with swapping of face images in a high precision value.

\section{Deepfake Generation Techniques of Faces}
StarGAN \cite{choi2018stargan}, proposed by Choi et al., is a method capable of performing imageto-image translations on multiple domains (such as change hair color, change gender,
etc.) using a single model. Trained on two different types of face datasets—CelebA \cite{7410782}
containing 40 labels related to facial attributes such as hair color, gender and age, and
RaFD dataset \cite{cho2019imagetoimage} containing 8 labels corresponding to different types of facial expressions
(“happy”, “sad”, etc.)—this architecture, given a random label as input (such as hair color, facial expression, etc.), is able to perform an image-to-image translation operation with impressive visual result. 

An interesting study was proposed by He et al. \cite{7410782} with a framework called
AttGAN in which an attribute classification constraint is applied in the latent representation to the generated image, in order to guarantee only the correct modifications of the
desired attributes. 

Finally, one of the most recent and powerful methods regarding the entire-face synthesis is the Style Generative Adversarial Network architecture or commonly called
StyleGAN. \cite{Giudice_2021}

\section{Deepfake Detection Techniques}
HFM images dataset and soft computing neural network models (SFFN) with an effective facial manipulating detection process were presented by Lee et al. (2021)\cite{lee2021detecting}. The SFFN model is capable of identifying fake images by focusing on altered facial landmarks, using only RGB information and no metadata. The method showed improved performance in AUC, with a 3.99\% F1-score and 2.91\% AUC for detecting handcrafted fake facial images, and 93.99\% accuracy for detecting small GANs-generated fake images.

Guo et al. (2021)\cite{guo2021fake} developed an AMTEN for image preprocessing. This component uses a convolution layer to retrieve photo manipulation traces, with weights adjusted during backpropagation for optimization. They also created a false face detector, AMTENnet, by combining AMTEN with a CNN. The manipulation traces from AMTEN are processed through the CNN to develop discriminative characteristics. Tests showed that AMTENnet achieved higher detection accuracy and generalization capabilities, outperforming other methods on the Hybrid Fake Face (HFF) dataset by 7.61\%.

Guarnera et al. (2020)\cite{guarnera2020fighting} completed a study on deepfake image analysis using an expectation-maximization technique to extract Convolutional Traces (CTs), a unique fingerprint that can identify if a photo is a deepfake and the GANs architecture that created it. The CT is resistant to attacks and independent of high-level picture concepts. The study found that a simple and fast-to-compute method could outperform more complex ones. By rotating input images to find the most significant direction, performance could be improved. The method achieved an overall classification accuracy of over 98\% on deepfakes from 10 different GAN architectures. It also performed well in a real-world setting, achieving 93\% accuracy on deepfakes created by the FACE application.

I.-J. Yu et al. (2020)\cite{yu2020manipulation} developed the MCNET to classify different manipulation techniques used on JPEG compressed images. The MCNet uses data from spatial, frequency, and compression domains to optimize manipulation classification. They developed domain-specific preprocessing and network topologies. The results showed that the MCNET performs better than existing manipulation detection networks and many low-level vision networks.

J. Yang et al. (2021)\cite{yang2021detecting} developed a method to detect the subtle textural differences between real and fake facial images. They used an enhanced guided filter for image preprocessing to highlight texture artifacts in modified facial images. These magnified texture variations were then learned using a Resnet18 network, which could downsample and resample to accurately identify real and fake facial images. Their method showed high detection accuracy and reduced training time due to the magnified texture characteristics. However, the method has limitations, including the need for large amounts of data for network model training and the necessity to train a new authentication network for each unknown face tampering approach.

Hsu et al. (2020) \cite{hung2021multi} developed a method to recognize fake images created by advanced GANs. Their approach involves a fake feature network-based paired learning system that can learn mid and high-level false features by combining cross-layer feature representations. They modified a reduced DenseNet into a two-stream network structure that can handle paired data. This network is trained to distinguish between the features of real and fake photos. A classification layer is added to determine if the input image is real or fake. Their system allows for learning of fake features, enabling the detector to recognize fake images created by a new GAN not included in the training phase. The results demonstrated that their method outperformed other techniques in terms of accuracy and recall rates.

%  The risks inherent in deepfakes, including defamation of character, potential harm to individuals, and the spread of fake news throughout society, highlight the importance of addressing these challenges.
 
%  Existing approaches suffer from problems such as inefficiency in deepfake image detection, high error rates, long computation times, and data access inaccuracies.
%  Our work focuses on improving efficiency through a different approach to using ResNet architecture for deepfake detection.
% There have been many approaches to detect image deepfake. Figure 1 (Heidari et al., 2023) \cite{heidari2023deepfake}  shows some of the advancements in the Image Deepfake techniques.
