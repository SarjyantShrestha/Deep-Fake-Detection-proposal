\chapter{Literature Review}
Deepfakes, which involve sharing facial images without permission, are often carried out without the knowledge or consent of individuals such as celebrities or politicians. At first, swapping of face image was done in the photo of Abraham Lincoln(Badale et al., 2018)\cite{badale2018deep}. Yang, Li \& Lyu (2019)\cite{yang2019exposing} have proposed a model to detect deep fake using head poses inconsistency. Yadav \& Salmani (2019)\cite{yadav2019deepfake} have described the working principle of the deep fake techniques along with swapping of face images in a high precision value.

Deepfakes are generally created by techniques based on
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) firstly introduced
by Goodfellow et al(2014). \cite{goodfellow2014generative}. GANs consist of generators and discriminators.The generator synthesizes a fake image from the given dataset, and the discriminator evaluates the authenticity of the generated image.


%  The risks inherent in deepfakes, including defamation of character, potential harm to individuals, and the spread of fake news throughout society, highlight the importance of addressing these challenges.
 
%  Existing approaches suffer from problems such as inefficiency in deepfake image detection, high error rates, long computation times, and data access inaccuracies.
%  Our work focuses on improving efficiency through a different approach to using ResNet architecture for deepfake detection.
There have been many approaches to detect image deepfake. Figure 1 (Heidari et al., 2023) \cite{heidari2023deepfake}  shows some of the advancements in the Image Deepfake techniques.
