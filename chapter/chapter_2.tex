Deep fakes, which involve the unauthorized swapping of face images, are frequently carried out without the knowledge or consent of individuals, including celebrities and politicians. Notably, historical instances, such as the facial image swapping in a photograph of Abraham Lincoln (Badale et al., 2018), underscore the longstanding nature of this challenge. Addressing these concerns, Yang, Li \& Lyu (2019) proposed a model leveraging head pose inconsistency to detect deep fakes, enabling the creation of synthetic faces for various individuals while preserving the original facial expressions.
Jagdale \& Shah (2019) introduced the NA-VSR algorithm for super resolution, involving video conversion into frames, median filtering to remove noise, and bicubic interpolation for pixel density enhancement. Additionally, Yadav \& Salmani (2019) elucidated the working principles of deep fake techniques, emphasizing the high precision value in face image swapping.
Generative Adversarial Neural Networks (GANs) play a pivotal role in deep fake generation, comprising a generator and a discriminator. The generator synthesizes fake images from a given dataset, while the discriminator evaluates the authenticity of the generated images. The inherent risks of deep fakes, including character defamation, potential harm to individuals, and the dissemination of fake news in society, highlight the importance of addressing these challenges.
Existing approaches encounter issues such as inefficiency in detecting deep fake images, high error rates, prolonged computation times, and data access inaccuracies. This work, FF-LBPH-DBN, focuses on minimizing computational complexity while efficiently applying various metrological parameters. Table 1 presents a survey-based overview of existing approaches for detecting fake images (Vivek et al., 2018).
