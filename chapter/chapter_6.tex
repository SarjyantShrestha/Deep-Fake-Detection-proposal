\begin{enumerate}
  \item Optimization of hyperparameters, involving the refinement and adjustment of key model parameters to enhance performance. This process ensures that the model operates at its optimal capacity by fine-tuning various settings.
  \item Enhancing the model training phase through the integration of additional augmentation techniques such as Gaussian blur and noise addition. These augmentations introduce diverse variations to the dataset, boosting the model's ability to generalize and improve its overall robustness.
