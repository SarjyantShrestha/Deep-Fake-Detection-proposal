The rise of deepfake technology, powered by advancements in deep learning, has brought a new phase to digital image manipulation. This project will address the pressing need for a robust deepfake detection system, focusing on facial features, and employs state-of-the-art ResNet architecture. The primary goal is to develop a deep learning model capable of accurately identifying manipulated facial images. We have analysed the existing methodologies regarding deepfake technologies and detection. For this project, We will be using 140k Real and Fake Images as our images dataset to  train the model. We have opted to integrate ResNet architecture into the deepfake detection process, with a specific emphasis on the training and rigorous testing of the model's efficiency. This project aims to contribute to ongoing efforts in mitigating the risks associated with deepfakes, ensuring the integrity of visual content in the era of advanced AI technologies.\\
