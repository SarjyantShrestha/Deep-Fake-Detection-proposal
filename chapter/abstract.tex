The rise of deepfake technology, powered by advancements in deep learning, has brought a new phase to digital image manipulation. This project addresses the pressing need for a robust deepfake detection system, focusing on facial features, and employs state-of-the-art ResNet architecture. The primary goal is to develop a deep learning model capable of accurately identifying manipulated facial images. We have analysed the existing methodologies regarding deepfake technologies and detection. For this project, We used 15k Real and Fake Images from Deepfake Detection and Reconstruction Challenge as our base dataset and augmented them to a total of 50k images to train the model. We have opted to integrate \acrshort{cnn} into the deepfake detection process, with a specific emphasis on the training and rigorous testing of the model's efficiency. We've achieved an accuracy of 93.8\% which is better than all the other proposed models in the challenge.\\
